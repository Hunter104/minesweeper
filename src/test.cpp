/* These are defined by the user (or the compiler)
   to specify the desired environment:

   __STRICT_ANSI__	ISO Standard C.
   _ISOC99_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C89 from ISO C99.
   _ISOC11_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C11.
   _ISOC23_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C99 from ISO C23.
   _ISOC2X_SOURCE	Old name for _ISOC23_SOURCE.
   _ISOC2Y_SOURCE	Extensions to ISO C23 from ISO C2Y.
   __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT2__
			Extensions to ISO C99 from TR 27431-2:2010.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_BFP_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-1:2014.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_FUNCS_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-4:2015.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_TYPES_EXT__
			Extensions to ISO C11 from TS 18661-3:2015.
   __STDC_WANT_IEC_60559_EXT__
			ISO C23 interfaces defined only in Annex F.

   _POSIX_SOURCE	IEEE Std 1003.1.
   _POSIX_C_SOURCE	If ==1, like _POSIX_SOURCE; if >=2 add IEEE Std 1003.2;
			if >=199309L, add IEEE Std 1003.1b-1993;
			if >=199506L, add IEEE Std 1003.1c-1995;
			if >=200112L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2004
			if >=200809L, all of IEEE 1003.1-2008
   _XOPEN_SOURCE	Includes POSIX and XPG things.  Set to 500 if
			Single Unix conformance is wanted, to 600 for the
			sixth revision, to 700 for the seventh revision.
   _XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED XPG things and X/Open Unix extensions.
   _LARGEFILE_SOURCE	Some more functions for correct standard I/O.
   _LARGEFILE64_SOURCE	Additional functionality from LFS for large files.
   _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=N	Select default filesystem interface.
   _ATFILE_SOURCE	Additional *at interfaces.
   _DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE_SOURCE Select correct (but non compile-time constant)
			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
   _GNU_SOURCE		All of the above, plus GNU extensions.
   _DEFAULT_SOURCE	The default set of features (taking precedence over
			__STRICT_ANSI__).

   _FORTIFY_SOURCE	Add security hardening to many library functions.
			Set to 1, 2 or 3; 3 performs stricter checks than 2, which
			performs stricter checks than 1.

   _REENTRANT, _THREAD_SAFE
			Obsolete; equivalent to _POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L.

   The `-ansi' switch to the GNU C compiler, and standards conformance
   options such as `-std=c99', define __STRICT_ANSI__.  If none of
   these are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE is defined, the default is
   to have _POSIX_SOURCE set to one and _POSIX_C_SOURCE set to
   200809L, as well as enabling miscellaneous functions from BSD and
   SVID.  If more than one of these are defined, they accumulate.  For
   example __STRICT_ANSI__, _POSIX_SOURCE and _POSIX_C_SOURCE together
   give you ISO C, 1003.1, and 1003.2, but nothing else.

   These are defined by this file and are used by the
   header files to decide what to declare or define:

   __GLIBC_USE (F)	Define things from feature set F.  This is defined
			to 1 or 0; the subsequent macros are either defined
			or undefined, and those tests should be moved to
			__GLIBC_USE.
   __USE_ISOC11		Define ISO C11 things.
   __USE_ISOC99		Define ISO C99 things.
   __USE_ISOC95		Define ISO C90 AMD1 (C95) things.
   __USE_ISOCXX11	Define ISO C++11 things.
   __USE_POSIX		Define IEEE Std 1003.1 things.
   __USE_POSIX2		Define IEEE Std 1003.2 things.
   __USE_POSIX199309	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, and .1b things.
   __USE_POSIX199506	Define IEEE Std 1003.1, .1b, .1c and .1i things.
   __USE_XOPEN		Define XPG things.
   __USE_XOPEN_EXTENDED	Define X/Open Unix things.
   __USE_UNIX98		Define Single Unix V2 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K        Define XPG6 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2KXSI     Define XPG6 XSI things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8       Define XPG7 things.
   __USE_XOPEN2K8XSI    Define XPG7 XSI things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE	Define correct standard I/O things.
   __USE_LARGEFILE64	Define LFS things with separate names.
   __USE_FILE_OFFSET64	Define 64bit interface as default.
   __USE_MISC		Define things from 4.3BSD or System V Unix.
   __USE_ATFILE		Define *at interfaces and AT_* constants for them.
   __USE_DYNAMIC_STACK_SIZE Define correct (but non compile-time constant)
			MINSIGSTKSZ, SIGSTKSZ and PTHREAD_STACK_MIN.
   __USE_GNU		Define GNU extensions.
   __USE_FORTIFY_LEVEL	Additional security measures used, according to level.

   The macros `__GNU_LIBRARY__', `__GLIBC__', and `__GLIBC_MINOR__' are
   defined by this file unconditionally.  `__GNU_LIBRARY__' is provided
   only for compatibility.  All new code should use the other symbols
   to test for features.

   All macros listed above as possibly being defined by this file are
   explicitly undefined if they are not explicitly defined.
   Feature-test macros that are not defined by the user or compiler
   but are implied by the other feature-test macros defined (or by the
   lack of any definitions) are defined by the file.

   ISO C feature test macros depend on the definition of the macro
   when an affected header is included, not when the first system
   header is included, and so they are handled in
   <bits/libc-header-start.h>, which does not have a multiple include
   guard.  Feature test macros that can be handled from the first
   system header included are handled here.  */

/* If none of the ANSI/POSIX macros are defined, or if _DEFAULT_SOURCE
   is defined, use POSIX.1-2008 (or another version depending on
   _XOPEN_SOURCE).  */
/* Some C libraries once required _REENTRANT and/or _THREAD_SAFE to be
   defined in all multithreaded code.  GNU libc has not required this
   for many years.  We now treat them as compatibility synonyms for

   comprehensive support for multithreaded code.  Using them never
   lowers the selected level of POSIX conformance, only raises it.  */

// Thirdly, partial ordering and overload resolution (of function templates)
// is highly costly in terms of compiler-resource.  It is a Good Thing to

  // 24.4.1 Reverse iterators
  /**
   *  Bidirectional and random access iterators have corresponding reverse
   *  %iterator adaptors that iterate through the data structure in the
   *  opposite direction.  They have the same signatures as the corresponding
   *  iterators.  The fundamental relation between a reverse %iterator and its
   *  corresponding %iterator @c i is established by the identity:
   *  @code
   *      &*(reverse_iterator(i)) == &*(i - 1)
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  <em>This mapping is dictated by the fact that while there is always a
   *  pointer past the end of an array, there might not be a valid pointer
   *  before the beginning of an array.</em> [24.4.1]/1,2
   *
   *  Reverse iterators can be tricky and surprising at first.  Their
   *  semantics make sense, however, and the trickiness is a side effect of
   *  the requirement that the iterators must be safe.

   * @ingroup sorting_algorithms
   *
   * These algorithms are variations of a classic binary search, and
   * all assume that the sequence being searched is already sorted.
   *
   * The number of comparisons will be logarithmic (and as few as
   * possible).  The number of steps through the sequence will be
   * logarithmic for random-access iterators (e.g., pointers), and
   * linear otherwise.
   *
   * The LWG has passed Defect Report 270, which notes: <em>The
   * proposed resolution reinterprets binary search. Instead of
   * thinking about searching for a value in a sorted range, we view
   * that as an important special case of a more general algorithm:
   * searching for the partition point in a partitioned range.  We
   * also add a guarantee that the old wording did not: we ensure that
   * the upper bound is no earlier than the lower bound, that the pair
   * returned by equal_range is a valid range, and that the first part
   * of that pair is the lower bound.</em>
   *
   * The actual effect of the first sentence is that a comparison
   * functor passed by the user doesn't necessarily need to induce a
   * strict weak ordering relation.  Rather, it partitions the range.

   We define __S<SIZE>_TYPE and __U<SIZE>_TYPE for the signed and unsigned
   variants of each of the following integer types on this machine.

	16		-- "natural" 16-bit type (always short)
	32		-- "natural" 32-bit type (always int)
	64		-- "natural" 64-bit type (long or long long)

	QUAD		-- 64-bit type, traditionally long long
	WORD		-- natural type of __WORDSIZE bits (int or long)
	LONGWORD	-- type of __WORDSIZE bits, traditionally long

   We distinguish WORD/LONGWORD, 32/LONG32, and 64/QUAD so that the
   conventional uses of `long' or `long long' type modifiers match the
   types we define, even when a less-adorned type would be the same size.
   This matters for (somewhat) portably writing printf/scanf formats for
   these types, where using the appropriate l or ll format modifiers can
   make the typedefs and the formats match up across all GNU platforms.  If
   we used `long' when it's 64 bits where `long long' is expected, then the
   compiler would warn about the formats not matching the argument types,
   and the programmer changing them to shut up the compiler would break the
   program's portability.

   Here we assume what is presently the case in all the GCC configurations
   we support: long long is always 64 bits, long is always word/address size,
   and int is always 32 bits.  */

//
// In your usual header, do something like:
//
//   #define __glibcxx_want_ranges
//   #define __glibcxx_want_concepts
//   #include <bits/version.h>
//
// This will generate the FTMs you named, and let you use them in your code as
// if it was user code.  All macros are also exposed under __glibcxx_NAME even
// if unwanted, to permit bits and other FTMs to depend on them for condtional
// computation without exposing extra FTMs to user code.

   *  @defgroup io I/O
   *
   *  Nearly all of the I/O classes are parameterized on the type of
   *  characters they read and write.  (The major exception is ios_base at
   *  the top of the hierarchy.)  This is a change from pre-Standard
   *  streams, which were not templates.
   *
   *  For ease of use and compatibility, all of the basic_* I/O-related
   *  classes are given typedef names for both of the builtin character
   *  widths (wide and narrow).  The typedefs are the same as the
   *  pre-Standard names, for example:
   *
   *  @code
   *     typedef basic_ifstream<char>  ifstream;
   *  @endcode
   *
   *  Because properly forward-declaring these classes can be difficult, you
   *  should not do it yourself.  Instead, include the &lt;iosfwd&gt;
   *  header, which contains only declarations of all the I/O classes as
   *  well as the typedefs.  Trying to forward-declare the typedefs
   *  themselves (e.g., <code>class ostream;</code>) is not valid ISO C++.
   *
   *  For more specific declarations, see
   *  https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/io.html#std.io.objects

/* If this file is compiled with threads support, it must
       #define __GTHREADS 1
   to indicate that threads support is present.  Also it has define
   function
     int __gthread_active_p ()
   that returns 1 if thread system is active, 0 if not.

   The threads interface must define the following types:
     __gthread_key_t
     __gthread_once_t
     __gthread_mutex_t
     __gthread_recursive_mutex_t

   The threads interface must define the following macros:

     __GTHREAD_ONCE_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_once_t
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT
     		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
     __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
		to initialize __gthread_mutex_t to get a fast
		non-recursive mutex.
		Define this to a function which looks like this:
		  void __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION (__gthread_mutex_t *)
     		Some systems can't initialize a mutex without a
		function call.  Don't define __GTHREAD_MUTEX_INIT in this case.
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT
     __GTHREAD_RECURSIVE_MUTEX_INIT_FUNCTION
     		as above, but for a recursive mutex.

   The threads interface must define the following static functions:

     int __gthread_once (__gthread_once_t *once, void (*func) ())

     int __gthread_key_create (__gthread_key_t *keyp, void (*dtor) (void *))
     int __gthread_key_delete (__gthread_key_t key)

     void *__gthread_getspecific (__gthread_key_t key)
     int __gthread_setspecific (__gthread_key_t key, const void *ptr)

     int __gthread_mutex_destroy (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_destroy (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_mutex_lock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_trylock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_mutex_unlock (__gthread_mutex_t *mutex);

     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_lock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_trylock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_unlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   The following are supported in POSIX threads only. They are required to
   fix a deadlock in static initialization inside libsupc++. The header file
   gthr-posix.h defines a symbol __GTHREAD_HAS_COND to signify that these extra
   features are supported.

   Types:
     __gthread_cond_t

   Macros:
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT
     __GTHREAD_COND_INIT_FUNCTION

   Interface:
     int __gthread_cond_broadcast (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_wait (__gthread_cond_t *cond, __gthread_mutex_t *mutex);
     int __gthread_cond_wait_recursive (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
					__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *mutex);

   All functions returning int should return zero on success or the error
   number.  If the operation is not supported, -1 is returned.

   If the following are also defined, you should
     #define __GTHREADS_CXX0X 1
   to enable the c++0x thread library.

   Types:
     __gthread_t
     __gthread_time_t

   Interface:
     int __gthread_create (__gthread_t *thread, void *(*func) (void*),
                           void *args);
     int __gthread_join (__gthread_t thread, void **value_ptr);
     int __gthread_detach (__gthread_t thread);
     int __gthread_equal (__gthread_t t1, __gthread_t t2);
     __gthread_t __gthread_self (void);
     int __gthread_yield (void);

     int __gthread_mutex_timedlock (__gthread_mutex_t *m,
                                    const __gthread_time_t *abs_timeout);
     int __gthread_recursive_mutex_timedlock (__gthread_recursive_mutex_t *m,
                                          const __gthread_time_t *abs_time);

     int __gthread_cond_signal (__gthread_cond_t *cond);
     int __gthread_cond_timedwait (__gthread_cond_t *cond,
                                   __gthread_mutex_t *mutex,

 * Extended scheduling parameters data structure.

 * This is needed because the original struct sched_param can not be

 * (e.g., in sched_getparam()).
 *
 * However, the possibility of specifying more than just a priority for
 * the tasks may be useful for a wide variety of application fields, e.g.,
 * multimedia, streaming, automation and control, and many others.
 *
 * This variant (sched_attr) allows to define additional attributes to
 * improve the scheduler knowledge about task requirements.
 *
 * Scheduling Class Attributes
 * ===========================
 *
 * A subset of sched_attr attributes specifies the
 * scheduling policy and relative POSIX attributes:
 *
 *  @size		size of the structure, for fwd/bwd compat.
 *
 *  @sched_policy	task's scheduling policy
 *  @sched_nice		task's nice value      (SCHED_NORMAL/BATCH)
 *  @sched_priority	task's static priority (SCHED_FIFO/RR)
 *
 * Certain more advanced scheduling features can be controlled by a
 * predefined set of flags via the attribute:
 *
 *  @sched_flags	for customizing the scheduler behaviour
 *
 * Sporadic Time-Constrained Task Attributes
 * =========================================
 *
 * A subset of sched_attr attributes allows to describe a so-called
 * sporadic time-constrained task.
 *
 * In such a model a task is specified by:
 *  - the activation period or minimum instance inter-arrival time;
 *  - the maximum (or average, depending on the actual scheduling
 *    discipline) computation time of all instances, a.k.a. runtime;
 *  - the deadline (relative to the actual activation time) of each
 *    instance.
 * Very briefly, a periodic (sporadic) task asks for the execution of
 * some specific computation --which is typically called an instance--
 * (at most) every period. Moreover, each instance typically lasts no more
 * than the runtime and must be completed by time instant t equal to
 * the instance activation time + the deadline.
 *
 * This is reflected by the following fields of the sched_attr structure:
 *
 *  @sched_deadline	representative of the task's deadline in nanoseconds
 *  @sched_runtime	representative of the task's runtime in nanoseconds
 *  @sched_period	representative of the task's period in nanoseconds
 *
 * Given this task model, there are a multiplicity of scheduling algorithms
 * and policies, that can be used to ensure all the tasks will make their
 * timing constraints.
 *
 * As of now, the SCHED_DEADLINE policy (sched_dl scheduling class) is the
 * only user of this new interface. More information about the algorithm
 * available in the scheduling class file or in Documentation/.
 *
 * Task Utilization Attributes
 * ===========================
 *
 * A subset of sched_attr attributes allows to specify the utilization
 * expected for a task. These attributes allow to inform the scheduler about
 * the utilization boundaries within which it should schedule the task. These
 * boundaries are valuable hints to support scheduler decisions on both task
 * placement and frequency selection.
 *
 *  @sched_util_min	represents the minimum utilization
 *  @sched_util_max	represents the maximum utilization
 *
 * Utilization is a value in the range [0..SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE]. It
 * represents the percentage of CPU time used by a task when running at the
 * maximum frequency on the highest capacity CPU of the system. For example, a
 * 20% utilization task is a task running for 2ms every 10ms at maximum
 * frequency.
 *
 * A task with a min utilization value bigger than 0 is more likely scheduled
 * on a CPU with a capacity big enough to fit the specified value.
 * A task with a max utilization value smaller than 1024 is more likely
 * scheduled on a CPU with no more capacity than the specified value.
 *
 * A task utilization boundary can be reset by setting the attribute to -1.

   the archive and shared versions of libpthread.   It can be used to
   determine the default pthread stack size.  There is a stub in some

  /** @defgroup functors Function Objects
   *  @ingroup utilities
   *
   *  Function objects, or _functors_, are objects with an `operator()`
   *  defined and accessible.  They can be passed as arguments to algorithm
   *  templates and used in place of a function pointer.  Not only is the
   *  resulting expressiveness of the library increased, but the generated
   *  code can be more efficient than what you might write by hand.  When we
   *  refer to _functors_, then, generally we include function pointers in
   *  the description as well.
   *
   *  Often, functors are only created as temporaries passed to algorithm
   *  calls, rather than being created as named variables.
   *
   *  Two examples taken from the standard itself follow.  To perform a
   *  by-element addition of two vectors `a` and `b` containing `double`,
   *  and put the result in `a`, use
   *  \code
   *  transform (a.begin(), a.end(), b.begin(), a.begin(), plus<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  To negate every element in `a`, use
   *  \code
   *  transform(a.begin(), a.end(), a.begin(), negate<double>());
   *  \endcode
   *  The addition and negation functions will usually be inlined directly.
   *
   *  An _adaptable function object_ is one which provides nested typedefs
   *  `result_type` and either `argument_type` (for a unary function) or
   *  `first_argument_type` and `second_argument_type` (for a binary function).
   *  Those typedefs are used by function object adaptors such as `bind2nd`.
   *  The standard library provides two class templates, `unary_function` and
   *  `binary_function`, which define those typedefs and so can be used as
   *  base classes of adaptable function objects.
   *
   *  Since C++11 the use of function object adaptors has been superseded by
   *  more powerful tools such as lambda expressions, `function<>`, and more
   *  powerful type deduction (using `auto` and `decltype`). The helpers for
   *  defining adaptable function objects are deprecated since C++11, and no
   *  longer part of the standard library since C++17. However, they are still
   *  defined and used by libstdc++ after C++17, as a conforming extension.

   *
   *  std::find_if (v.begin(), v.end(), not1(IntGreaterThanThree()));

   *  The call to `find_if` will locate the first index (i) of `v` for which
   *  `!(v[i] > 3)` is true.
   *

   *  from the base classes `unary_function` and `binary_function`).

   *  Adaptors are provided to turn pointers to unary (single-argument) and

   *  long-winded functor `pointer_to_unary_function` is constructed with a
   *  function pointer `f`, and its `operator()` called with argument `x`
   *  returns `f(x)`.  The functor `pointer_to_binary_function` does the same
   *  thing, but with a double-argument `f` and `operator()`.

   *  The function `ptr_fun` takes a pointer-to-function `f` and constructs

  // 20.3.6 binders
  /** @defgroup binders Binder Classes
   * @ingroup functors
   *
   *  Binders turn functions/functors with two arguments into functors
   *  with a single argument, storing an argument to be applied later.
   *  For example, a variable @c B of type @c binder1st is constructed
   *  from a functor @c f and an argument @c x. Later, B's @c
   *  operator() is called with a single argument @c y. The return
   *  value is the value of @c f(x,y). @c B can be @a called with
   *  various arguments (y1, y2, ...) and will in turn call @c
   *  f(x,y1), @c f(x,y2), ...
   *
   *  The function @c bind1st is provided to save some typing. It takes the
   *  function and an argument as parameters, and returns an instance of
   *  @c binder1st.
   *
   *  The type @c binder2nd and its creator function @c bind2nd do the same
   *  thing, but the stored argument is passed as the second parameter instead
   *  of the first, e.g., @c bind2nd(std::minus<float>(),1.3) will create a
   *  functor whose @c operator() accepts a floating-point number, subtracts
   *  1.3 from it, and returns the result. (If @c bind1st had been used,
   *  the functor would perform <em>1.3 - x</em> instead.
   *
   *  Creator-wrapper functions like @c bind1st are intended to be used in
   *  calling algorithms. Their return values will be temporary objects.
   *  (The goal is to not require you to type names like
   *  @c std::binder1st<std::plus<int>> for declaring a variable to hold the
   *  return value from @c bind1st(std::plus<int>(),5).
   *
   *  These become more useful when combined with the composition functions.
   *
   *  These functions are deprecated in C++11 and can be replaced by
   *  @c std::bind (or @c std::tr1::bind) which is more powerful and flexible,
   *  supporting functions with any number of arguments.  Uses of @c bind1st
   *  can be replaced by @c std::bind(f, x, std::placeholders::_1) and
   *  @c bind2nd by @c std::bind(f, std::placeholders::_1, x).

   *  @brief  The actual work of input and output (interface).
   *  @ingroup io
   *
   *  @tparam _CharT  Type of character stream.
   *  @tparam _Traits  Traits for character type, defaults to
   *                   char_traits<_CharT>.
   *
   *  This is a base class.  Derived stream buffers each control a
   *  pair of character sequences:  one for input, and one for output.
   *
   *  Section [27.5.1] of the standard describes the requirements and
   *  behavior of stream buffer classes.  That section (three paragraphs)
   *  is reproduced here, for simplicity and accuracy.
   *
   *  -# Stream buffers can impose various constraints on the sequences
   *     they control.  Some constraints are:
   *     - The controlled input sequence can be not readable.
   *     - The controlled output sequence can be not writable.
   *     - The controlled sequences can be associated with the contents of
   *       other representations for character sequences, such as external
   *       files.
   *     - The controlled sequences can support operations @e directly to or
   *       from associated sequences.
   *     - The controlled sequences can impose limitations on how the
   *       program can read characters from a sequence, write characters to
   *       a sequence, put characters back into an input sequence, or alter
   *       the stream position.
   *     .
   *  -# Each sequence is characterized by three pointers which, if non-null,
   *     all point into the same @c charT array object.  The array object
   *     represents, at any moment, a (sub)sequence of characters from the
   *     sequence.  Operations performed on a sequence alter the values
   *     stored in these pointers, perform reads and writes directly to or
   *     from associated sequences, and alter <em>the stream position</em> and
   *     conversion state as needed to maintain this subsequence relationship.
   *     The three pointers are:
   *     - the <em>beginning pointer</em>, or lowest element address in the
   *       array (called @e xbeg here);
   *     - the <em>next pointer</em>, or next element address that is a
   *       current candidate for reading or writing (called @e xnext here);
   *     - the <em>end pointer</em>, or first element address beyond the
   *       end of the array (called @e xend here).
   *     .
   *  -# The following semantic constraints shall always apply for any set
   *     of three pointers for a sequence, using the pointer names given
   *     immediately above:
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer, then @e xbeg and @e xend shall
   *       also be non-null pointers into the same @c charT array, as
   *       described above; otherwise, @e xbeg and @e xend shall also be null.
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xnext < @e xend for an
   *       output sequence, then a <em>write position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e *xnext shall be assignable as the next element
   *       to write (to put, or to store a character value, into the sequence).
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xbeg < @e xnext for an
   *       input sequence, then a <em>putback position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e xnext[-1] shall have a defined value and is the
   *       next (preceding) element to store a character that is put back
   *       into the input sequence.
   *     - If @e xnext is not a null pointer and @e xnext< @e xend for an
   *       input sequence, then a <em>read position</em> is available.
   *       In this case, @e *xnext shall have a defined value and is the
   *       next element to read (to get, or to obtain a character value,
   *       from the sequence).

   *  @brief  Quick and easy way to eat whitespace
   *
   *  This manipulator extracts whitespace characters, stopping when the
   *  next character is non-whitespace, or when the input sequence is empty.
   *  If the sequence is empty, @c eofbit is set in the stream, but not
   *  @c failbit.
   *
   *  The current locale is used to distinguish whitespace characters.
   *
   *  Example:
   *  @code
   *     MyClass   mc;
   *
   *     std::cin >> std::ws >> mc;
   *  @endcode
   *  will skip leading whitespace before calling operator>> on cin and your
   *  object.  Note that the same effect can be achieved by creating a
   *  std::basic_istream::sentry inside your definition of operator>>.

// In your usual header, do something like:
//
//   #define __glibcxx_want_ranges
//   #define __glibcxx_want_concepts
//   #include <bits/version.h>
//
// This will generate the FTMs you named, and let you use them in your code as
// if it was user code.  All macros are also exposed under __glibcxx_NAME even
// if unwanted, to permit bits and other FTMs to depend on them for condtional
// computation without exposing extra FTMs to user code.

//   #define __glibcxx_want_ranges
//   #define __glibcxx_want_concepts
//   #include <bits/version.h>
//
// This will generate the FTMs you named, and let you use them in your code as
// if it was user code.  All macros are also exposed under __glibcxx_NAME even
// if unwanted, to permit bits and other FTMs to depend on them for condtional
// computation without exposing extra FTMs to user code.
